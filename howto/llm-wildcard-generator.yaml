# ========================================================================
# LLM PROMPT FOR GENERATING A CUSTOM WILDCARD FILE
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Change the `user_theme` value to your desired theme.
# 2. Copy the *entire* content of this file.
# 3. Paste it into your LLM (Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) and run the prompt.
# 4. The LLM will output a new, complete YAML file based on your theme.
# ========================================================================

# 1. USER: Define Your Core Theme
# Replace the placeholder with your desired theme.
# Examples: "Cyberpunk", "High Fantasy", "Cozy Bakery", "Lovecraftian Horror", "Steampunk"
user_theme: "[YOUR_THEME_HERE]"

# 2. LLM: Instructions for Generation
llm_instructions:
  - "You are an expert in generative AI prompting and creative writing."
  - "Your task is to create a comprehensive wildcard YAML file based on the `user_theme` provided above."
  - "The file must be 100% valid YAML."
  - "The top-level key *must* be a short, memorable name based on the theme (e.g., if the theme is 'Cyberpunk', the key could be 'my_cyberpunk')."
  - "You *must* follow the structure defined in `generation_structure`."
  - "For each category (like `primary_subjects`, `settings`, etc.), you must generate at least 15-20 diverse, high-quality options."
  - "Incorporate Stable Diffusion-style weighting (e.g., (detailed:1.2)) where it adds meaningful emphasis to an option."
  - "The 'combo' categories *must* correctly reference other categories using the `__top_level_key/category_name__` syntax. (e.g., `__my_cyberpunk/primary_subjects__`)."
  - "The `spotlight_prompts` must be complete, highly detailed prompts, not just single items."
  - "The `negative_prompt` must include general bad-art terms AND theme-specific exclusions (e.g., for a 'Cyberpunk' theme, add 'fantasy, magic, medieval')."
  - "Do not include these instructions in your final YAML output. The output should begin *only* with the top-level theme key."

# 3. Define the Desired Output Structure
# LLM: Use this as the template for your output.
# Do not just copy this structure; *fill it in* with content based on the user_theme.
# Change the category names (e.g., 'primary_subjects') to be specific to the theme (e.g., 'character_class', 'vehicle_type', 'food_item').
generation_structure:
  "[theme_name]": # This MUST be replaced with the short theme name

    spotlight_prompts:
      - "[A complete, detailed, and evocative prompt fitting the theme, e.g., 'a (grizzled veteran:1.2) in heavy power armor, standing in a (rain-soaked neon alley:1.1), (volumetric fog:1.2), cinematic lighting, detailed illustration']"

      - "text, watermark, signature, (worst quality:1.2), (low quality:1.2), (bad anatomy:1.3), extra limbs, (missing limbs:1.2), poorly drawn, fused fingers, (too many fingers:1.2)"
      - "[LLM adds theme-specific negatives here, e.g., 'fantasy, magic, medieval, swords' for a sci-fi theme]"
